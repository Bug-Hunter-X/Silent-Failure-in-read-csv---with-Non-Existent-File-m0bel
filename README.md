This repository demonstrates a common, yet easily overlooked, error in R: the silent failure of `read.csv()` when attempting to read a file that does not exist.  The `bug.r` file shows the problematic code.  The `bugSolution.r` file provides a solution that explicitly checks for file existence before attempting to read it. This is crucial for robust error handling and preventing unexpected program behavior.
